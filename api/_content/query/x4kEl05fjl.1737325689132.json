Now I know that it's just the chain rule (with a veeeery long chain).

Despite the simplicity of the network, actually understanding how it works under the hood is critical in understanding later concepts which come up when scaling up the network.

You could take this as a fact, or you could go back to the lesson about back propagation and the chain rule and realize why that's the case."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"makemore"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"makemore"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"makemore is a really great follow up to micrograd because while micrograd teaches you how to build pytorch under the hood, makemore explains how to use it.

The last time I read it, I sort of knew what a neural network is and could tell you the equations for regularization (enough to pass classes) but barely had an intuition for how it worked. A lot still went over my head on the second read but now it makes much more sense. It kind of reminds me of when I was a kid interested in computers and reading some Wikipedia articles and feeling like they were way more complex than they needed to be. But as an adult with years of computer science context, it turns out that those Wikipedia articles were actually pretty succinct and I was just a dumb little kid. I'm looking forward to coming back to papers like this and fully understanding them enough to reimplement them.

This one is a much simpler paper but I can also tell that a lot of parts would have gone well over my head if I had tried reading it a month ago. It also probably helps that I literally just implemented it. Being somewhat of a seminal paper, it doesn't have to build off on that much prior knowledge. Instead, a lot of the terminology that it uses is stuff that I almost take for granted at this point (like using vectors and matrices to represent certain concepts like layers and inputs)"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"personal-projects"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Personal Projects"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I haven't worked on anything here yet unless you count making small tweaks to the makemore code or building a 4-gram model to compare against the MLP model.
